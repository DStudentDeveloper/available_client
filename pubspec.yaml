description: At Central University, students often encounter difficulty in finding available 
  lecture halls, especially during peak hours when multiple courses overlap. The academic 
  complex, primarily composed of several tall buildings with multiple floors, requires students 
  and course representatives to physically check each floor and room to locate free spaces. Two 
  buildings are actively used for lecture purposes, but the complex layout, combined with Central
  University’s large student population, makes this process time-consuming and inefficient.
  
  The Available App is designed to streamline this process by providing 
  real-time updates on room occupancy statuses across the academic complex. Course 
  representatives can mark rooms as occupied when a class starts and update the room’s 
  availability when the class ends. Additionally, they can specify start and end times, allowing 
  the app to send automated notifications reminding users to update room statuses. This feature 
  ensures that rooms are promptly marked as free once a class concludes, improving room 
  availability for other students.
